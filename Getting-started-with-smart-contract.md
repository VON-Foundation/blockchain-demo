## Introduction to Binance Smart Chain Development for Beginners  
This curriculum provides a step-by-step path for newcomers to build and deploy smart contracts on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet. Designed for zero prior experience, you'll learn essential tools, write your first contract, and deploy it risk-free using test tokens. The focus is on practical, executable steps with minimal theory.  

### 1. Environment Setup (15 minutes)  
**Tools to install**:  
- **MetaMask**: Browser wallet for interacting with BSC ([Download here](https://metamask.io)) [3]  
- **Remix IDE**: Web-based editor for Solidity contracts (no installation needed; access at [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)) [5][6]  
- **BSC Testnet Configuration**:  
  - In MetaMask: Add BSC Testnet using these parameters:  
    ```markdown
    Network Name: BNB Chain Testnet  
    RPC URL: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/  
    Chain ID: 97  
    Currency Symbol: tBNB  
    Block Explorer: https://testnet.bscscan.com  
    ```
  ([Follow visual guide](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain)) [3]  
- **Get test tokens**: Use the [BSC Faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart) to receive free tBNB for testing [3][4].  

### 2. Write Your First Smart Contract (30 minutes)  
**Objective**: Create a basic BEP-20 token.  
1. Open Remix IDE and create a new file `MyToken.sol`.  
2. Paste this starter code:  
    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    contract MyToken {
        string public name = "VONDemo";
        string public symbol = "VON";
        uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000;
        mapping(address => uint256) balances;
        constructor() {
            balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
        }
        function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
            require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
            balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
            balances[to] += amount;
        }
        function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256) {
            return balances[account];
        }
    }
    ```
3. **Compile**:  
   - In Remix, go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab.  
   - Set compiler version to `0.8.0+`.  
   - Click "Compile MyToken.sol" [6].  

### 3. Deploy to BSC Testnet (10 minutes)  
1. In Remix:  
   - Navigate to "Deploy & Run Transactions".  
   - Select "Injected Web3" (connects to MetaMask).  
   - Ensure MetaMask is set to **BSC Testnet**.  
2. Click "Deploy".  
3. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask [6][7].  
4. **Verify deployment**:  
   - Copy the contract address from Remix.  
   - Check it on [BscScan Testnet](https://testnet.bscscan.com) [6].  

### 4. Interact with Your Contract (15 minutes)  
1. **In Remix**:  
   - Under "Deployed Contracts", expand your contract.  
   - Test functions:  
     - `balanceOf(yourAddress)` to see your tokens.  
     - `transfer(recipientAddress, amount)` to send tokens [1][3].  
2. **In MetaMask**:  
   - Add your token:  
     - Click "Import tokens" > Enter contract address.  
     - Send test transactions between wallets [3].  

### 5. Next Steps: Level Up Your Skills  
- **Security practices**: Use OpenZeppelin’s audited contracts (e.g., for ERC-20) [1][2].  
- **Automated testing**: Learn Truffle/Hardhat for advanced testing [1][7].  
- **Real-world templates**: Explore [Binance’s Spot Testnet](https://testnet.binance.org) for trading simulations [8].  

### Key Resources  
- **BSC Documentation**: [Binance Developer Portal](https://developers.binance.org)  
- **Debugging**: Use Remix’s debugger and [BscScan Testnet](https://testnet.bscscan.com) for transaction analysis [5][6].  
- **Community Support**: [Binance Developer Chat](https://t.me/BinanceDev)  

> "Start small—deploy a basic token first. Complexity grows with experience." [2][4]  

This path minimizes setup complexity while maximizing hands-on practice. Within 1 hour, you’ll have a live contract on BSC Testnet. Experiment freely—testnet tokens have no real value, making it ideal for rapid iteration [8][3].
